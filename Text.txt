Hey connections !!
Along with my learning react journey I have created a project using React js called FoodCon.
During this project, I learned some awesome stuff, like how to make a search feature work smoothly and how to give my app a stylish look using style components in React. Plus, I dived into filter sections – making it easier for users to find exactly what they're craving. Oh, and I even figured out how to fetch data from APIs in real-time!
Feel free to check out the app [insert link to your app]🌐🍕
